## Course Description:

The course is intended to give a broad background to the computational problems and techniques that an astronomer is most likely to encounter. The emphasis will be to develop skills in logical thinking, basic programming and data analysis by means of extensive programming exercises, based on astrophysical problems, using mainly Python. Most of the lecture sessions are devoted to tutorial exercises and hands-on programming experience. Further exercises are provided as homework which will count towards the final mark. The idea behind the course is to instill familiarity with logical thinking and to develop programming skills.

The course does not only make use of well-known software packages, but rather seeks to build an understanding of the fundamentals underlying scientific computations.
